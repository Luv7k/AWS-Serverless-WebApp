# AWS-Serverless-WebApp
In this project, I'm building an AWS serverless web application to determine the angle between an analog clock's hour and minute hands using four AWS services: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AWS Amplify, and DynamoDB. Even though it is a very basic web application, it connects all the essential components that we will use to build a much larger application for the real world.
